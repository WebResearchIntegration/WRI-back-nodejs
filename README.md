Here are the routes you can work with:

1. ARTICLES
    1. Relationships

1. QUESTIONS
1. AUTHORS

Inside the **Neo4j** database, it's possible to play with articles data via the API provided.

### Get Article By Id
**[GET]:** `/api/article/<id>` will get one article from the database with the provided id. If not, will throw a **404**.

### Get all articles
**[GET]:** `/api/article/` Will get all articles inside the database, will give back an array or an error.
